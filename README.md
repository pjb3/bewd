# Object-Oriented Order Calculator

In this assignment we will be creating an object-oriented order total price calculator. Your branch already has a failing test, your job is to make it pass. You will not need to make changes to the test file, but feel free to add more tests to the test file if it can help you in developing the code. Create a new file named 'order.rb' and put your code in there.

This assignment builds upon the previous example. Instead of hard coding the products, you will download a Comma-Separated File from a website and use that data to populate the products. You should use the CSV and Net/HTTP modules from the standard library to accomplish this task.
